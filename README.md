            Password Generator

    This is a password generator that is able to make a password anywhere between 8 to 128 in text. 
    It can use uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters, but you have to choose between at least 8 or 128 or it won't work other wise, and you will be reset to the beginning with a promt telling you to pick at least 8 or at most 128.
      A promt will tell to you pick atlest one of the lowercase, uppercase, numbers or the special characters or you will be reset and get a promt telling you to pick one.

            I added a rest.css to the project.
